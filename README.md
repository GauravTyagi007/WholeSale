# WholeSale
The wholesale management database system contains the details of the stock that is brought from the
buyers and The details of the customers can also be stored, these details can help in various calculations
and verification, henceforth reducing the ambiguity.
Wholesalers typically buy and sell in bulk quantities. This is an important chara cteristic, as bulk
transactions imply handling most of the logistical functions such as storage, finance, and transportation at
a much higher volume and scale than typical retailers. Handling such high volume transactions requires
spe cialized skills and capabilities. Wholesale database management system provides such expertise by
combining both the strengths of database language like SQL, and enterprise application builder like Java
and provides the user, with a encapsulated use of sof tware without much technical expertise.
